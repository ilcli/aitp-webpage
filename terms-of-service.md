# Terms of Service  
**Last updated:** 2025-08-12  

## 1. Acceptance of Terms  
By booking a consultation or engaging Synqer.ai ("we", "our", "us") for services, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not proceed with our services.  

## 2. Nature of Services  
Synqer.ai provides **custom automation and workflow solutions** for municipalities, government bodies, and organizations. Services may include:  

- Consultation and needs assessment  
- Workflow design and automation development  
- Integration with client-owned systems  
- Training and handover of solutions  
- Optional post-deployment support (if agreed in writing)  

**Important:** We do **not** operate a public SaaS platform.  
All development is tailored per client and deployed locally or in client-controlled environments.  

## 3. Consultation & Project Engagement  
The initial booking through our website is for a **discovery call only**.  
Project scope, timeline, and pricing will be agreed in a separate written proposal or contract before any work begins.  

## 4. Data Ownership & Security  
- All sensitive data (e.g., API keys, system IDs, spreadsheet IDs) remains the property of the client.  
- Such credentials are only entered into systems in a secure, mutually agreed environment.  
- After delivery, all access credentials are transferred to the client, and Synqer.ai retains no live access unless explicitly requested for support.  

## 5. Confidentiality  
Both parties agree to keep confidential all non-public information shared during the engagement.  

## 6. Payments  
Payment terms and milestones are specified in individual project agreements. Unless otherwise agreed, payments are non-refundable once development begins.  

## 7. Limitation of Liability  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Synqer.ai is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Our total liability is limited to amounts paid for the specific project giving rise to the claim.  

## 8. Termination  
Either party may terminate an engagement by written notice if the other party breaches these Terms.  

## 9. Force Majeure  
We are not responsible for delays or failures caused by events beyond our reasonable control.  

## 10. Governing Law  
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Israel.  
Disputes will be handled in the competent courts of Tel Aviv-Jaffa.
